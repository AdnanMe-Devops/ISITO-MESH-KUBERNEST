A ConfigMap is an Kubernetes API object used to store non-sensitive configuration data in key-value pairs. A ConfigMap can be consumed by a Pod in the following ways:

As an environment variable
As a command-line argument
As a file in a volume
 ConfigMap values are exposed to pods as environment variables.
