Understand how the single Kubernetes Service registers both the V1 and V2 Deployment frontend pods. It purposely references the role: frontend label only:

 frontend:

apiVersion: v1
kind: Service
metadata:
  name: frontend
  labels:
    role: frontend
spec:
  ports:
  - name: http
    port: 80
    protocol: TCP
    targetPort: 80
  selector:
    role: frontend
A Service is an abstraction that allows you to expose the Pods created by a Deployment to in-cluster network traffic. A Service has it's own DNS name internally in a Kubernetes cluster. By using this abstraction to access a Deployment's Pods, Pods behind the Service can be added and removed without affecting availability of the Deployment.
